# JavaFractalGrapher
Java program to graph Mandelbrot set and some other fractals. Has a basic GUI for controlling the image. In the future the GUI should be improved and the auto step size selection should be better. Additionally in the future the zoom in/out should keep the image centered. 


To run the program execute the main function in FractalGui.java.
